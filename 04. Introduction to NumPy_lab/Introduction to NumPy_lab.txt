Lab 4: Introduction to NumPy
Objectives
Understand the fundamental features and benefits of using NumPy.
Learn how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays.
Perform basic indexing and slicing on arrays.
Utilize built-in NumPy functions for common operations.
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Python programming.
Familiarity with lists, loops, and basic functions in Python.
Introduction
NumPy is a powerful open-source library used in Python for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these structures.

Lab Tasks
Task 1: Import NumPy and Create Arrays
Step 1.1: Import NumPy Library
To use NumPy, you first need to import it. Itâ€™s a common practice to use the alias np.

import numpy as np
Step 1.2: Create a 1D Array
You can create a one-dimensional array using the array() function.

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("1D Array:", arr1)
Step 1.3: Create a 2D Array
To create a two-dimensional array, pass a list of lists.

arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("2D Array:")
print(arr2)
Task 2: Perform Basic Indexing and Slicing
Step 2.1: Access Elements
Access elements in a NumPy array using indices, similar to Python lists.

element = arr1[2]  # Accessing the third element of arr1
print("Accessed Element:", element)
Step 2.2: Slicing
Slice a subset of elements from an array.

subarray = arr2[0:2, 1:3]  # Extracting a subarray
print("Sliced Array:")
print(subarray)
Task 3: Use Built-in NumPy Functions
Step 3.1: Reshape an Array
The reshape() function allows you to change the dimensions of an array.

reshaped_array = arr1.reshape(5, 1)
print("Reshaped Array:")
print(reshaped_array)
Step 3.2: Calculate Mean
Find the mean of all elements in an array using the mean() function.

mean_value = np.mean(arr1)
print("Mean:", mean_value)
Step 3.3: Sum of Elements
Use the sum() function to get the total sum of elements.

total_sum = np.sum(arr2)
print("Total Sum:", total_sum)
Conclusion
In this lab, you've learned the basics of the NumPy library in Python, including how to create arrays, perform indexing and slicing, and utilize built-in functions. With these skills, you can efficiently handle and process numerical data in your Python projects. NumPy serves as a foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python, making it an essential tool for data analysis and machine learning.
