Lab 2: Setting Up Your AI Environment
Objectives
Install Python and essential libraries for AI and machine learning.
Verify successful installation through test scripts.
Understand the setup process for a basic AI development environment.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of command-line interfaces.
Administrative access to your computer to install software.
Tasks
Task 1: Install Python
1.1: Check for Python Installation
Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
Type the following command to check if Python is already installed:
python --version
If Python is installed, this command will output the version number.
1.2: Install Python (if not installed)
Visit the official Python website.
Download the latest version of Python suitable for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions, ensuring you select the option to add Python to your PATH.
Task 2: Install Libraries
2.1: Install NumPy
Open your terminal.
Install NumPy using pip (Python's package installer):
pip install numpy
NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
2.2: Install Pandas
Install Pandas using pip:
pip install pandas
Pandas is crucial for data manipulation and analysis.
2.3: Install Scikit-learn
Install scikit-learn using pip:
pip install scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library providing simple and efficient tools.
Task 3: Verify Installations
3.1: Test NumPy Installation
Create a new Python script file (e.g., test_numpy.py) and add the following code:
import numpy as np

# Create a sample NumPy array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("NumPy array:", array)
Run the script:
python test_numpy.py
You should see the array printed as output if NumPy is correctly installed.
3.2: Test Pandas Installation
Create a new Python script file (e.g., test_pandas.py) and add the following code:
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample Pandas DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [24, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Pandas DataFrame:\n", df)
Run the script:
python test_pandas.py
The output should display the DataFrame if Pandas is installed correctly.
3.3: Test Scikit-learn Installation
Create a new Python script file (e.g., test_sklearn.py) and add the following code:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
print("Iris dataset, target names:", iris.target_names)
Run the script:
python test_sklearn.py
Verify the successful execution if you see the target names of the Iris dataset printed.
Conclusion
Successfully installed Python and essential AI libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
Verified the installations through test scripts.
You have now set up the foundational environment required for AI and machine learning projects.
Now, you are ready to dive deeper into AI and machine learning concepts with your newly configured environment!
